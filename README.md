# Hollows
A published choose your adventure story app - the first of many apps that I will be publishing since finishing LondonAppBrewery's iOS Dev course in Sum '19. It is available at https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/hollows/id1476165643
The app consists of a start view, followed by a navigation view consisting of the prologue and the first chapter with the model consisting of a binary tree with each choice leading down a different branch with one only one leaf node containing a good ending to the story.
